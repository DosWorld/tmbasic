The file 'tvision.ide' was created with Borland C++ 4.52 under Windows XP.
Borland Turbo Assembler 4.0 and DOS PowerPack are also required.
All these actually work better in Windows XP than in older Windows versions.
Turbo Assembler needs a patch to work in Windows 95, for instance.

This project file includes the required targets to build 16-bit and 32-bit
libraries which can later be linked from applications using Turbo Vision.

Steps to build:

1.  Create a folder for the temporal files of each target in the project:
    'objdos32' and 'objdos'.
2.  Copy 'tv.inc' from the source code files to this location. It's the
    easiest way to let the assembler find it.
3.  Generate the include files 'tvwrite.inc' and 'tvwrit32.inc' required to
    compile the assembly files. To do this, build in first place the targets
    'geninc' and 'geninc32', then run the generated executables from the
    command prompt and redirect their output, e.g. 'geninc > tvwrite.inc'
    and 'geninc32 > tvwrit32.inc'.
4.  Before building the Turbo Vision library, you should create a 'lib'
    folder in the root directory so that the IDE can place the .lib files
    there.

Update 2019/06/23:

A makefile has been added to build the Turbo Vision library and sample applications
from the command line, using Borland's MAKE utility. The requirements are the same:
Borland C++, Turbo Assembler, DOS PowerPack. Doing it this way makes it possible to
build 32-bit binaries under 64-bit Windows 10 (although the installers for these
tools are 16-bit, so you'll have to run them somewhere else).

If you get the error "Fatal: Command arguments too long", upgrade MAKE to the one
bundled with Borland C++ 5.x.

The makefile requires being built from the 'project' folder. It is not currently
possible to change this behaviour.
