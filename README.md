TMBASIC is a simple programming language for creating console applications that run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Apps written in TMBASIC can be simple command line tools or sophisticated mouse-driven user interfaces.
Everything you need is built-in.

## Project status
TMBASIC is under development. Stay tuned!

## Why?

There are many options for developing rich graphical user interfaces (GUIs) today, both on the web and on the desktop. Text user interfaces (TUIs) are an older technology, so why consider writing a TUI-based app using TMBASIC today?

<strong><i>Timeless.</i></strong> Modern interface conventions are constantly evolving. Web and desktop apps look outdated after a few years. TUIs have a classic appeal that transcends modern fads and trends.

<strong><i>Easy to write.</i></strong> Developing a high-quality modern GUI requires professional-level expertise. TUIs have few options for visual effects, and even a novice can produce quality results.

<strong><i>Easy to publish.</i></strong> TMBASIC apps are standalone executable files that require no supporting libraries. They can be copied and opened without installation.

<strong><i>Easy cross-platform support.</i></strong> The same TUI works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux. One build in TMBASIC produces executables for all supported platforms.

<strong><i>Easy to get started.</i></strong> The BASIC language will feel familiar to anyone with programming experience. New programmers will find it easy to learn. Everything you need to develop and distribute sophisticated apps is included in TMBASIC.

TMBASIC supports all major desktop computers. It even runs on mobile devices using the terminal apps <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243">iSH Shell</a> (iOS) and <a href="https://termux.com/">Termux</a> (Android). TMBASIC running on any platform can produce single-file executables for any other supported platform. No external libraries are required.
