.procedure Characters
.description
Converts a t[String] value into a list of "grapheme clusters," or what human readers would intuitively understand as "characters."

In languages using a Latin script, a letter or an accent are considered separate graphemes.
A grapheme i[cluster] is the Latin letter combined with its accents.

For example, consider the text value "né" formed by three code points:
code@
"n" + "e" + Chr(769)
' 769 is the code point for "COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT"
@

The function p[Len] returns 3 for this text because there are three code points.
However, there are only two grapheme clusters: `n` and `é`.
The p[Characters] function returns `["n", "é"]` for this text.

By default, p[Characters] uses the `en_US` locale unless a i[locale] is specified.
.overload
.parameter this: String
Any text value.
.return List of String
A list of the characters (grapheme clusters) in i[this].
.example
.example-code
dim s = "n" + "e" + Chr(769)
dim x = s.Characters
print x(0).len  ' one code point: "n"
print x(1).len  ' two code points: "e" + Chr(769)

.overload
.parameter this: String
Any text value.
.parameter locale: String
The locale to use.
This is either a language code like `en` or a combination of language and region like `en_US`.
Use the p[AvailableLocales] function to retrieve the list of all possible locales.
.return List of String
A list of the characters (grapheme clusters) in i[this].

dim s = "n" + "e" + Chr(769)
dim x = s.Characters("fr_FR")
print x(0).len  ' one code point: "n"
print x(1).len  ' two code points: "e" + Chr(769)
