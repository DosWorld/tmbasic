h1[`Optional` Type]

Normally, a variable is required to have a value.
For instance, a variable of type t[Number] will always contain some number, by default zero.
Sometimes it is useful to have a variable that may or may not have a value.

code@
dim a as Number    ' default value is zero
print a            ' prints 0

dim b as Optional Number
print HasValue(b)  ' prints false
b = 5
print HasValue(b)  ' prints true
print Value(b)     ' prints 5
@

This example demonstrates the usage of an `Optional` type.
Declare a variable with {`dim`:statement_dim} and include the keyword `Optional` before the type.

The variable will initially contain no value.
Use p[HasValue] to check whether an `Optional` variable contains a value.
If it does, usa p[Value] to retrieve the value.
