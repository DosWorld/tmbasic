h1[`Map` Type]

A `Map` is like a dictionary.
By looking up a key, you can find the value associated with it.

code@
dim <VARIABLE> as Map from <KEY-TYPE> to <VALUE-TYPE>
@

If you have keys of type `Number` corresponding to values of type `String`, then a map of those pairings would be `Map from Number to String`.

code@
dim x as Map from Number to Number
x(111) = 999
print x(111)  ' prints 999
@

Use parentheses to set or retrieve values in a list by passing in the corresponding key.

code@
dim map myMap
    for i = 1 to 10
        yield i to 2 * i
    next
end dim
@

If you need to build up a map, use {`dim map`:statement_dim_collection} rather than repeatedly appending to the list.
