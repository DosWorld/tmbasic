h2[Usage]

The `input` statement reads a line of text from the user's keyboard.
It waits for the user to type something and then press Enter.
Then it stores their entered value into the specified variable.

The example below uses the {`print` statement:statement_print} to prompt the user to enter their name.
After the user types a name and presses Enter, that name is stored in the `name` variable.
Then, `print` is used again to greet the user by name.

code@
sub Main()
    print "Name? ";
    dim name as String
    input name
    print "Hi "; name; "!"
end sub
