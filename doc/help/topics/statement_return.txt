h1[`return` Statement]

A function is a procedure that returns a value to its caller.
In a function, the `return` statement provides the return value and exits the function.
Every function must ultimately return a value in all code paths.

A subroutine is a procedure that does not return a value.
In a subroutine, the `return` statement just exits the function and does not provide a return value.
It's not necessary for a subroutine to contain a `return` call, but it can be used to exit the subroutine early.

h2[Syntax]

This example demonstrates a function that calculates a simple math formula and returns the result.

code@
function Squared(x as Number) as Number
    return x * x
end function

sub Main()
    print Squared(2)  ' prints 4
end sub
