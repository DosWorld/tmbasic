h1[Logical Operators]

t[Boolean] logic is used to make decisions from multiple conditions.
These operators take t[Boolean] operands and produce a t[Boolean] result.

ul@
li@`x and y`: `true` if both x and y are `true`.@
li@`x or y`: `true` if either x or y is `true`.@
li@`not x`: `true` if x is `false`.@

See the documentation for the t[Boolean] type for more information.
