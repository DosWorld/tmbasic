h1[`dim list`, `dim map`, and `dim set` Statements]

This is a modified version of the {`dim` statement:statement_dim} that allows you to populate a collection at the same time that you declare it.
In addition to being faster for the computer, it's less typing than other ways to build up a collection.

This form of `dim` contains an arbitrary code block that builds up the collection.
Use {`yield`:statement_yield} to add items to the collection.

h2[Syntax]

code@
dim list <VARIABLE>
    ...
    yield <VALUE>
    ...
end dim

dim map <VARIABLE>
    ...
    yield <KEY> to <VALUE>
    ...
end dim

dim set <VARIABLE>
    ...
    yield <VALUE>
    ...
end dim
@

ul@
li@`<VARIABLE>` is the name of the new variable to be declared.@
li@`<KEY>` (maps only) is the key to be used in the map entry.@
li@`<VALUE>` is the value to be used in the collection entry.@
@

h2[Usage]

This example builds a list of the numbers from 1 to 10.
The type of `myList` is implicitly `List of Number`.

code@
dim list myList
    for i = 1 to 10
        yield i
    next
end dim
@
