h1[Subroutine Call Statement]

Subroutines are procedures that do not return a value (as opposed to functions which do).
They perform actions.

p[CreateDirectory] is an example of a built-in subroutine.
You can define your own subroutines as well.

h2[Syntax]

code@
<NAME>
<NAME> <ARGUMENTS>
@

ul@
li@<NAME> is the name of the subroutine to call.@
li@<ARGUMENTS> are the comma-separated values to pass into the subroutine.@
@

This syntax is similar to function calls, except that no parentheses are needed around the argument list.

h2[Usage]

The following example calls the built-in p[CreateDirectory] subroutine.

code@
CreateDirectory "my_dir"
@
