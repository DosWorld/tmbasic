h1[`Set` Type]

A `Set` is a collection of unique values.
If you add a value to a `Set` that already contains that value, the `Set` will not change.

code@
dim <VARIABLE> as Set of <TYPE>
@

If you have values of type `Number`, then a set of unique numbers would be `Set of Number`.

code@
dim x as Map of Number
x = x + 999
x = x + 999  ' already added; this has no effect
print Contains(x, 999)  ' prints true
