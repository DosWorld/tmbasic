h1[`Record` Type]

A record is a group of fields treated as a single unit.
For example, a record for a person might have fields for the person's name, age, and address.
A record for a book might have fields for the book's title, author, and ISBN number.

You could store these fields in separate variables, but storing them together in a record makes it possible to pass them around as a unit.
Putting records into a t[List] is a common way to store tabular data.

code@
' Anonymous record
dim <VARIABLE> as Record (<FIELD> as <TYPE>, ...)

' Named record
type <TYPE-NAME>
    <FIELD> as <TYPE>
    ...
end type
@

You can give a name to a record type by using a `type` block.
List the fields one per line.

Using the `Record (...)` syntax, records can be passed around without needing to define a type with a name.

code@
' Literal anonymous record
dim x = {{ foo: 1, bar: 2 }

' To get a named record, cast from a literal anonymous record to the named type.
dim x = {{ foo: 1, bar: 2 } as MyRecord
@

This literal syntax is a convenient and efficient way to construct records.

code@
print x.foo
@

Access fields using the `.` operator.
