h1[`dim` Statement]

`dim` declares a new variable.
The variable has a name and either a type or an initial value.
If an initial value is provided, then the type is inferred from that value.
If a type is provided, then a default initial value is chosen for that type.

Use {`const`:statement_const} to declare a constant that cannot be changed.

h2[Syntax]

code@
dim <VARIABLE> as <TYPE>
dim <VARIABLE> = <VALUE>
@

ul@
li@`<VARIABLE>` is the name of the new variable to declare.@
li@`<TYPE>` is the type of variable, like t[Number] or t[String].@
li@`<VALUE>` is the initial value.@

h2[Usage]

The following simple example declares a new variable named `x`. The initial value is 5, and so the type of the variable is t[Number].

code@
dim myVariable = 5
