h1[`continue` Statement]

The `continue` statement works inside of a loop such as {`for`:statement_for}.
It causes the loop to jump to the next iteration, skipping any remaining statements in the loop body.
It is invalid outside of a loop body.

h2[Syntax]

code@
continue
@

There are no arguments.
Typically, you would use an {`if`:statement_if} statement to decide whether to continue or not.

h2[Usage]

The following example prints each number from 1 to 10 except 5.

code@
for i = 1 to 10
  if i = 5 then continue
  print i
next
@
