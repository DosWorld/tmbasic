h1[`rethrow` Statement]

`rethrow` statements let you re-raise an error that has been caught in a {`catch`:statement_try} block.
The `rethrow` statement must be inside a `catch` block.

h2[Syntax]

code@
try
    ...
catch
    ...
    rethrow
end try
@

h2[Usage]

Use `rethrow` if you want to handle some errors but not others.
Commonly, you may want to check the p[ErrorCode] and handle specific error codes and `rethrow` the rest.

code@
try
    ...
catch
    if ErrorCode() = ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND then
        print "File not found!"
    else
        rethrow
    end if
end try
