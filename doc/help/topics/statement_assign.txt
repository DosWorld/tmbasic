h1[Assignment (`=`) Statement]

An assignment statement is how you put a value into a variable.
The variable must have been previously declared with a {`dim` statement:statement_dim}.

The new value must match the type of the variable.
It overwrites any existing value.

h2[Syntax]

code@
<VARIABLE> = <VALUE>
@

ul@
li@`<VARIABLE>` is the name of the existing variable to assign to.@
li@`<VALUE>` is the new value to put into the variable.@
@

h2[Usage]

The following trivial example shows the basic usage.

code@
dim myVariable = 5
print myVariable  ' initially 5
myVariable = 6    ' replace the old value with 6
print myVariable  ' now it is 6
@
