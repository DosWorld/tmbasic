h1[`select case` Statement]

`select case` is a code flow mechanism that allows you to choose one of several different code paths based on the value of a variable or expression.

A common use case is handling menu options.
The user enters a menu option, and the program executes the requested section of code.
A `select case` can be used to choose the correct code path based on the input.

h2[Syntax]

code@
select case <INPUT>
    case <VALUE>
        <STATEMENTS>
    case <VALUE>, <VALUE>, ...
        <STATEMENTS>
    case <VALUE> to <VALUE>
        <STATEMENTS>
    case else
        <STATEMENTS>
end select
@

ul@
li@`<INPUT>` is the value used to determine which code path to take. Commonly, it is a t[Number], but any type works.@
li@`<VALUE>` is matched against `<INPUT>`. If the value matches, then that code path is taken.@
li@`<STATEMENTS>` is the code to execute if the value matches.@
@

If a `case else` block is provided, then it will be executed if no other `case` matches.

h2[Usage]

This example shows the flexibility of specifying case values.

code@
for i = -1 to 6
    select case i
        case -1 to 1, 4 to 5
            print i; ": -1 to 1, 4 to 5"
        case 2 to 3
            print i; ": 2 to 3"
        case else
            print i; ": else"
    end select
next
