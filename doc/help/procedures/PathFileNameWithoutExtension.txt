.procedure PathFileNameWithoutExtension
.category File I/O
.blurb Gets the part of the filename before the final dot.
.description
Gets the part of the filename before the final dot.
Use p[PathExtension] to return the rest of the filename starting with the final dot.

If there are multiple dots in the filename, all but the last one are included in this function's result.
For instance, `PathFileNameWithoutExtension("test.tar.gz")` returns `"test.tar"`.

This is done by manipulating the path string.
No disk access is performed and the path does not need to actually exist.
.overload
.parameter path: String
Path to a directory or file.
.return String
Part of the filename before the final dot.
If the filename does not contain a dot, then the whole filename is returned.
