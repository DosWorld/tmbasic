.procedure UtcOffsets
.category Dates and Times
.blurb Calculates the difference between UTC and another time zone for a particular local time.
.description
Calculates the difference between UTC and another time zone for a particular local time.

For nearly all times, this returns one offset.

However, two offsets may be returned on the Daylight Saving Time autumn "fallback" transition hour.
In the United States, clocks roll back by an hour at 2:00 AM.
This means that the hour from 1:00 AM to 2:00 AM occurs twice in local time.

If you ask this function for the UTC offset of 1:30 AM on that day, there are two possible UTC offsets: the one before the transition, and the one after.
Both offsets will be returned by this function.
.overload
.parameter dateTime: DateTime
The local time for which to calculate the UTC offset.
.parameter timeZone: TimeZone
The local time zone.
.return List of TimeSpan
One or two time spans representing the time zone's offset from UTC.
