.procedure FileExists
.category File I/O
.blurb Checks whether a file exists or not.
.description
Returns whether a file exists at the given path and filename.

The user may not have permission to view files in the given path.
In that case, `false` is returned even though the file may exist.

Warning: This function is easy to misuse.
Keep in mind that other programs are running at the same time as your TMBASIC program.
Another program may create/delete the file in between the call to p[FileExists] and the subsequent read or write of the file.
In computer programming this is called a {time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) bug:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use}.

It is better to try performing the file operation without checking for file existence. Then, catch any `ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` errors.
.overload
.parameter filePath: String
Path and filename.
.return Boolean
`true` if the file exists.
