.procedure PathExtension
.category Files
.blurb Gets the file extension (like `.txt`) from a path.
.description
Gets the file extension (like `.txt`) from a path.
This is the part of the filename starting at the final dot.
Use p[PathFileNameWithoutExtension] to return the rest of the filename before the final dot.

If there are multiple dots in the filename, only the last one is considered.
For instance, `PathExtension("test.tar.gz")` returns `".gz"`.

This is done by manipulating the path string.
No disk access is performed and the path does not need to actually exist.
.overload
.parameter path: String
Path to a directory or file.
.return String
Extension, including the dot.
If the filename does not contain a dot, then an empty string is returned.
