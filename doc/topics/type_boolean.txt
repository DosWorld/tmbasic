h1["boolean" Type]

A t[boolean] value can be either `true` or `false`.
The name "boolean" comes from George Boole, a 19th century mathematician who invented the algebraic system for these `true` and `false` values.

Boolean values are used to make decisions.
For instance, an {`if` statement:ref_if} uses a boolean value to decide whether to run one block of statements or another.
A {`while` statement:ref_while} uses a boolean value at the end of each loop to decide whether to loop again.

The values `true` and `false` can be used directly, as in the following example.

code@
dim x as boolean
x = true
x = false
@

The {`not` operator:ref_not} will change a `true` value to `false`, or a `false` value to `true`.

code@
dim x = not false  ' x is true
dim y = not x      ' y is false
@
